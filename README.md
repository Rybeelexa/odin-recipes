# odin-recipes
This is a recipes project on the Odin Project. 
It's basically my first project there.
It's meant to mainly test my knowledge and improve my skillset in HTML5. So, I should be pretty good in HTML when I'm done with it.
I will also be styling the project with CSS later, so it should also help improve my CSS skillset.
