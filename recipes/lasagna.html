    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is a recipe for the <strong>'World's Best Lasagna'</strong></p>
    <p>It was originally created by the late <strong>John Chandler</strong>, so all the credit goes to him. I am going to try it myself though. It seems rather interesting. And who wouldn't want a delicious self-made lasagna slipping down their throats to their awaiting stomachs? I know I would. So let's get into it!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
      <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
      <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 egg</li>
      <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Step 1</strong><br>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5</strong><br>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving</li>
    </ol>
